After cleaning and joining we had data points of 321195 entries .

#Features 

Client Profiles: Demographics like age, gender, and account details of our clients.
Digital Footprints: A detailed trace of client interactions online, divided into two parts: pt_1 and pt_2. Itâ€™s recommended to merge these two files prior to a comprehensive data analysis.
Experiment Roster: A list revealing which clients were part of the grand experiment.

An A/B test was employed by Vanguard because they believed a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI), coupled with timely in-context prompts (cues, messages, hints, or instructions provided to users directly within the context of their current task or action), could make the online process smoother for clients.

#Objective
What I would attempt to answer with this analysis is if the new UI leads to higher completion rates?

#Conclusion
Design Decision: The new design (Test group) does not show a statistically significant improvement over the old design (Control group) when adjusted for a 5% increase in completion rate. It suggests that the new design may not be more effective than the old design under the given conditions.

Further Investigation: We should consider revisiting the design changes or the threshold used. Additional factors and more data might provide further insights.
